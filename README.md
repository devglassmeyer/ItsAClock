This is the first “release” version. This is a windows form/dialog that shows the current date & time along with the time zone. Additional time zones can be added. The form has no title bar, but it can be dragged around anywhere.

This version targets .NET Framework 6.0 because this is the framework that originally shipped with Windows 10.

Something I threw together because I wanted to know the current time.
