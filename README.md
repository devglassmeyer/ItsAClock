This is a windows form/dialog that shows the current date & time along with the time zone. Additional time zones can be added. The form has no title bar, but it can be dragged around anywhere.

This version targets .NET Framework 6.0 because this is the framework that originally shipped with Windows 10.

Something I threw together because I wanted to know the current time. And in multiple time zones. And just because.

Future plans inlcude option for showing seconds, saving the the very special list of selected time zones, and saving the window position. So make sure you fill out that registration card, put a stamp on it and mail it off to keep up with the latest and greatest goings on here at ItsAClock. Every 31418th card received will get a special gift. Maybe even a fruit basket. Who knows? I sure don't.
